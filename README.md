## About

Cidbot is a personal project bot that utilizes [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) to interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). I have added commands that I think are fun and/or useful to my community. Cidbot uses slash commands for interactions. These commands currently include:

- /roll - Allows users to claim pictures of my cat Cid ("Cid Pics") for themselves.
- /im - Allows users to look up information on a specific Cid Pic.
- /mm - Allows users to view all of their current Cid Pics.
- /avatar - Returns the avatar of the specified user.



## Future plans

Currently, this bot is only operable in my own private discord, which can be joined [here](https://discord.gg/ftwB68m). I plan to modify the code so that anyone can use the bot in their own discord, or even take the source and make their own version of it.

I also have plans to add additional commands to increase the usefulness of the bot. These include:

- Time based roll/claim limit
- Server Moderation - Actions like kicking or banning users.
- Role Handling - Adding roles, automatic role assignment, opt-in roles.
- Custom images in rolls/claims.
- Custom soundboard - Users can provide links to sound files they can later use to play in voice channels.
- Image modification - User provides imgur link and bot returns a modified image based on options.
- Guild currency
- Customizable permissions on commands
